### general behavior
* add OpenGL switch (need harfbuzz first)
* allow search for multiple (separate) tokens
* use sqlite instead of files
* separate into gui and backend? (for use as library)

### loaders
* add extension support (through bash scripts or lua maybe)

### interface
* gtk icons
* anchor selection so it doesn't jump when something above it loads
